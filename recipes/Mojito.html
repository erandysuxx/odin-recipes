    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching libation. It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. But it's well worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the most popular to this day.</p>
