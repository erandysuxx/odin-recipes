    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine pasta is stirred through a silky sauce of double cream, parmesan and butter in this fantastic treat-yourself meal. Grab a fork – and a quiet corner – and eat your way to pasta heaven…</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g dried fettucine</li>
        <li>splash olive oil</li>
        <li>100mil double cream</li>
        <li>parmesan chesse</li>
        <li>100b butter</li>
        <li>Handful flatleaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the fettuccine for 7-8 minutes, or until a little underdone. Drain the pasta reserving 400ml water. Toss the pasta with flaky sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a splash of olive oil to stop it sticking.</li>
        <li>Heat the cream, cheese and butter in a large, deep heavy-based frying pan for a few minutes and stir over a medium heat. Pour in the reserved pasta cooking water and bring to the boil. Season generously and stir in the cooked pasta.</li>
        <li>Gently simmer the pasta in the sauce, stirring, for 4-5 minutes. The sauce may look a little runny at first, but it will thicken and become coating consistency as it cools. Turn off the heat, let the pasta stand for 1 minute, toss through the parsley, season to taste and serve in bowls with extra parmesan.</li>
